* Introduction

Treasure Isles is a tabletop game that can be played by children and
adults. This document includes basic rules, such that can be
understood by young pirates, but extension rules are also provided
that can evolve this game into a more engaging experience.

* Requirements

To play the game, you need islands, something to keep track of
resources, a ship for each player, markers for ports, a single
standard (D6) die, and a ruler or measuring tape.

Apart from the die, all of the above can be created by cutting up
pices of paper and drawing them yourself. If you're doing this, it
might be a good idea to glue to paper to card before cutting it out.

Other alternatives are using toys you have around, or getting pirate
themed miniatures.

Ships should be roughly 2"/5cm in length,

Islands can be any size and quantity, based on your available playing
area. Just make sure to leave enough space to sail in between!

For port markers, you need one for each player, and then six
additional ones, numbered 1-6. These should be about the size of a
coin.

There are three resources in the game: rum, sugar, and spices. One
option is to use small blocks of LEGO or similar (brown, white and red
respectively). Additionally something to keep track of money. This can
all be done by writing numbers on a ledger rather than using physical
objects.

* Setup

First position the islands around the play area. These can be anywhere
and in any configuration as long as there is enough space to travel
betwen them. Then each player gets to choose a different island to
place their home port on. Place their port marker down, and their ship
next to it. Then roll on the following table.

| 1 | Sells rum    | Buys sugar  |
| 2 | Sells rum    | Buys spices |
| 3 | Sells sugar  | Buys rum    |
| 4 | Sells sugar  | Buys spices |
| 5 | Sells spices | Buys rum    |
| 6 | Sells spices | Buys sugar  |

This will be the economy for the home port for the remainder of the
game.

Each player starts off with 5 gold.

* Rules

Play starts with the youngest, or the best pirate impression. Choose a
direction and a distance to move in. The ship can move up to 6". When
a distance is chosen, then roll to see whether the ship can travel
that fast. If moving 6", then you need to roll 6+, when moving 5",
then you need to roll 5+ etc. If the roll was successful, move the
ship to the new location. If the roll failed, then first move the ship
the distance rolled and roll for an event (see Events section below).

If the player makes contact with an island, and there are not yet 6
additional ports in play, then they can search for a new port or for
buried treasure (see Searching section below). If they come in contact with a
known port, then the player can initiate a trade (see Trade section
below). If the ship comes in contact at any point with an opposing
player's ship then the ship must stop movement and resolve
combat (see Combat section below). Only if the combat is successful
can the ship continue any remaining travel they have remaining that
turn.

** Searching

When a ship is in contact with an island, it can choose to search the
island.

If fewer than 6 ports exist in the game, then the player can search
for a new port. On a roll of 4+, place a numbered port marker on the
coast, next to where the ship made contact. Roll on the table in Setup
to establish the economy of this port.

At any point, a ship may search for buried treasure. On a roll of 6+,
then the player finds a cache of gold coins, whose value is D6/2,
rounded up. So if they roll 3, they get 2 gold.

** Trading

When a player ship visits a port, it can choose to buy or sell various
goods. These are: Rum, Sugar, Spices. The cost of these depends on the
economy of the port:

|            | Cost |
|------------+------|
| Buys item  |    5 |
| Normal     |    4 |
| Sells item |    3 |

It is therefore beneficial to buy in ports that sell the items cheap,
and sell in those that buy them a higher price.

Additionally, when the player ship visits their home port, they can
repair their ship at the cost of 2 gold per point of damage.

** Combat

Each player rolls, and the player with a lower value loses half their
cargo, or the opponent's remaining hitpoints in gold, to be decided by
negotiations.

These negotiations could be as simple as agreeing what one player is
willing to give up, and what the other player would accept, another
dice roll, or a friendly sword duel (when playing with children, use
balloon swords!) If the receiving ship cannot hold all of the cargo,
then the remaining is lost.

The loser of the initial combat roll-off also loses 1 point of damage
on their ship. If their ship has lost all remaining hitpoints then she
ship is sunk.

** Events

In the basic rules, there is only one event. No need to roll or choose
which event occurs.

*** Storm
Move the amount rolled in the movement phase, on a 4+, otherwise do
not move at all.
eg
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Alice decides to try to move 6" but rolls a 4 and gets stuck in a
storm. To navigate the storm, she then rolls a 5, allowing her to move
her original roll of 4".  Bill similarly tries to move 6" and also
rolls a 4, getting stuck in a storm. Unfortunately he fails his storm
roll, and can not move his ship at all this turn.

* Winning the game

There wre two victory conditions. The first player to reach 30 gold
from trade and piracy will succeed in an economic victory.
Alternatively, if you are the last player with an unsunk ship, you
have 

* Ships

In the basic rules, there is only one ship type available. If any
stats are marked as +0, these are unused in the basic rules.

** Sloop

A basic ship with good speed and average cargo capacity

| Speed     | +0 |
| Cargo     |  5 |
| Hitpoints |  5 |
| Attack    | +0 |
| Cost      | 20 |
