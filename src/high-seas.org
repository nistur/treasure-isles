* Introduction

This is an expansion to the rules for Treasure Isles. It adds some
more rules to provide a richer gaming experience. All existing rules
from the core game are still valid.

* Setup

After setting up the game as per the core rules, position one non
player ship for each player in the game. These should be positioned at
the edge of the play area and are classed as Sloops for the purposes
of any rules. 

* Requirements

* Rules

** Movement

If a player has multiple ships, they can either move them separately,
using two separate movement phases in their turn, or treat them as a
single unit. The player must announce when multiple ships join, or
leave a convoy. When they are grouped together like this, then for the
purposes of the rules they act like a single ship with the combined
stats of all the ships in the convoy. Any damage applied to the group
must still be distributed between the ships however, although it can
be decided by the players involved in the combat how this is to be
resolved. 

** Non Player Ships

After every player has had their turn, choose one player to move all
non-player ships on the table. A good way of deciding this would be to
start with the person clockwise of the person who started the game,
and then each subsequent round, going around the table. These ships
will move towards any port, including player home ports. They will not
engage any ships or ports in combat, but players may engage them.

If fewer than 6 non player ships are currently active, then the player
in control of the non player ships may choose to roll, and on a 4+,
another ship can be placed either at the edge of the play area, or at
any non player port. The class of this ship is to be chosen from the
pool of available ships by the player in control at that time.

** Trading

At the end of each round, after every player has gone, count through
the ports positioned in order, ignoring home ports. Roll a D6, if that
port has already been positioned then re-roll for the economy of that
port from the table in the core rules under 'Setup'.

** Combat

If a player has succeeded in combat, the player may choose, rather
than looting the ship as described in the core game rules, to attempt
to commandeer the ship. To do this, they have to roll the difference
of damage points between the ships.
eg
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Alice has successfully beaten Bill in combat. Her ship has a full 5
damage remaining, but Bill's ship is down to 1 damage. Alice rolls a
D6 and gets a 4, just narrowly managing to commandeer the ship.
#+END_QUOTE

A successful capture will lead to the player obtaining control of the
ship, at its current state of disrepair, and all of the gold and cargo
aboard.

Non player ships will always provide gold when being looted. When
being captured, they contain a full cargo hold. To calculate which
item they are transporting, roll against the port economy table in the
'Setup' section of the core rules, and picking the item in the 'Sells'
column.

* Winning the game

* Ships

High Seas introduces several new ship classes. If you are playing with
Port of Nassau rules, then these can be purchased at a
shipyard. Alternatively they can also be captured as non-player ships.
