* Introduction

This is an expansion to the rules for Treasure Isles. It adds some
more rules to provide a richer gaming experience. All existing rules
from the core game are still valid, except that the economic victory
condition is replaced with the one below.

* Requirements

Additional to the requirements of the core game, you will need a way
to note that a port has been upgraded, and something to represent
another resource type, wood. There should be enough of these
available, as wood stocks are tracked and build up over time.

Also recommended would be to have a variety of different ship
pieces. If using paper, these can be drawn as needed, but will need
some way to differentiate their different classes.

* Rules

The following rules supplement those in Treasure Isles.

** Combat

It is possible to attack a port. The combat works in the same way as
ship combat with the port getting +1 to their attack roll. If the
player loses the roll, they always lose 5 gold, or suffer an
additional 1 point of damage if the ship is not holding 5 gold. If the
player succeeds, the port loses one upgrade of the player's choosing,
including logging camps. If the port does not have any upgrades then
it is removed from the map.

** Upgrading

When docked at a port, a player may invest in the infrastructure of
that port. For 10 gold, they may fund a logging camp. Each logging
camp will produce 1 wood per turn. This wood is available to all
traders at the same price of 4 gold per wood. No ports will buy
wood. Home ports cannot have logging camps.

The player may transport wood to their home port and offload it. When
the stockpile in the home port reaches 20 wood, they may use it to
upgrade one of three things.

*** Shipyard

The player can buy additional ships at their home port. A ship cannot
move on the turn it was purchased. A ship can be sold for half its
value.

*** Tavern

The ship gets a token after having docked at their home port after the
tavern has been upgraded. This token is only valid for the next voyage
until the ship docks in another port. At any point the player can
exchange this token for either +1 on their next roll, or to re-roll
the previous roll. It is not possible to add +1 after having already
rolled.

*** Treasury

Building a treasury allows players to stash their gold at their home
port, making it less of a target for rival pirates. This gold cannot
be used for trades unless it is once again retrieved.

*** Fortress

Once all three upgrades have been built, then the player may collect a
further 50 wood and 20 gold to build a fortress to defend the port.

* Winning the game

The conquest victory condition remains from the core game, but an
economic victory is now when a player succesfully builds their
fortress.

* Ships

Port of Nassau introduces several new ship classes which can be
purchased at the Shipyard.

** Merchant Brig

A sturdy vessel designed for hauling large quantities of cargo,
sacrificing speed for increased storage capacity.

| Speed     | -3 |
| Cargo     | 10 |
| Hitpoints |  8 |
| Attack    | +0 |
| Cost      | 50 |

** Cutter

A nimble ship built for speed and maneuverability, perfect for swift
attacks and fast travel.

| Speed     | +2 |
| Cargo     |  2 |
| Hitpoints |  4 |
| Attack    | +1 |
| Cost      | 20 |
