This is a simple tabletop game I'm working on. The idea is that it
should have relatively few rules for children to understand, but still
be interesting enough for adults to play, and allow for extensibility
for more complex rules to be added later.

It is very very very much still a work in progress. A lot of the
numbers have been picked out of thin air and have not been thoroughly
playtested.

If you decide to give it a go, please provide feedback via the github issues.

## Requirements

Everything should be clear in the document, however as a quick
overview, the things that you will need to play are:
- A standard die (D6)
- Some measuring device capable of measuring inches
   Not having a metric/imperial debate - I'm very much on the side of
   metric, but for tabletop gaming, inches are a more useful unit.
- Paper

It's possible to substitute the paper for miniatures or just stand-in
toys if desired, just that paper is the lowest barrier to entry, plus
allows your little ones to be able to be involved in the creation of
the game.

## Extensions

There are plans to have extensions to the game. These will be written
up and provided once the core rules have been playtested to be fun
enough to continue with. For the interest of anyone reading this, an
example of these would be:
- Additional ship types to upgrade the player's ship
  - Larger ships with lower speed but larger cargo storage.
  - Faster ships with smaller storage.
- Rules for running a fleet rather than just a single ship.
- NPC ship behaviours.
- Ship capture mechanics.
- Additional events.
- Port economy changing to counteract static trade routes.

These extensions will be formatted similar to the core rules, in a
leaflet which will combine several new rules together into a package
which feels cohesive.

## Feedback

Any feedback at all, whether it is criticism about some of the rules,
ideas about how to improve it, or just photos of the game being
played, please feel free to create a [github
issue](https://github.com/nistur/treasure-isles/issues).
