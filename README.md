# Treasure Isles
[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This is a simple tabletop game I'm working on. The idea is that it
should have relatively few rules for children to understand, but still
be interesting enough for adults to play, and allow for extensibility
for more complex rules to be added later.

It is very very very much still a work in progress. A lot of the
numbers have been picked out of thin air and have not been thoroughly
playtested.

If you decide to give it a go, please provide feedback via the github issues.

## Requirements

Everything should be clear in the document, however as a quick
overview, the things that you will need to play are:
- A standard die (D6)
- Some measuring device capable of measuring inches
   Not having a metric/imperial debate - I'm very much on the side of
   metric, but for tabletop gaming, inches are a more useful unit.
- Paper

It's possible to substitute the paper for miniatures or just stand-in
toys if desired, just that paper is the lowest barrier to entry, plus
allows your little ones to be able to be involved in the creation of
the game.

## Expansions

There are two expansions to the core rules of Treasure Isles. These
can be used independently of each other, or combined. It it obviously
possible to cherry pick specific rules from these expansions to fit
your game. They are designed not so that the core game should feel
lacking, but rather to add more depth to the game.

NOTE: They are provided so that the core game can be balanced with
them in mind. They are not complete yet, to an even greater extent
than the core rules.

### Port of Nassau

Every port starting to feel the same? This expansion gives you the
ability to upgrade ports and improves the trading in the game. It adds
some more ships, and a few more things to do with them.

### High Seas

More interested in sailing the high seas and raising the jolly roger?
This expansion provides more rules for making the seafaring more
interesting, capture mechanics, non player ships, and dynamic trade
routes.
