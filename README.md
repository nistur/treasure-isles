This is a simple tabletop game I'm working on. The idea is that it
should have relatively few rules for children to understand, but still
be interesting enough for adults to play, and allow for extensibility
for more complex rules to be added later.

It is very very very much still a work in progress. A lot of the
numbers have been picked out of thin air and have not been thoroughly
playtested.

If you decide to give it a go, please provide feedback via the github issues.

## Requirements

Everything should be clear in the document, however as a quick
overview, the things that you will need to play are:
- A standard die (D6)
- Some measuring device capable of measuring inches
   Not having a metric/imperial debate - I'm very much on the side of
   metric, but for tabletop gaming, inches are a more useful unit.
- Paper

It's possible to substitute the paper for miniatures or just stand-in
toys if desired, just that paper is the lowest barrier to entry, plus
allows your little ones to be able to be involved in the creation of
the game.

## Extensions

There are two extensions planned. The first of these is Port of
Nassau. This expansion is focused on expansion of the player's
port. This is already in progress, but not ready for release yet. The
second expansion has the working title High Seas, and will provide
more dynamic trade routes, as well as more interesting actions while
not at port.

## Read the rules

The recommended way to read the rules is to download and print [the
latest
release](https://github.com/nistur/treasure-isles/releases/latest/).

You can however read the latest version of [the core rules
here](../main/src/treasure-isles.org). Also available is the [work in
progress extension, Port of Nassau](../main/src/port-of-nassau.org).

## Feedback

Any feedback at all, whether it is criticism about some of the rules,
ideas about how to improve it, or just photos of the game being
played, please feel free to create a [github
issue](https://github.com/nistur/treasure-isles/issues).
